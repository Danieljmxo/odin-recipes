    <h2>Chef John's Perfect Prime Rib</h2>

    <p>Use my easy "mathematical method" for cooking prime rib, and you'll be rewarded with the best prime rib that's perfectly pink and delicious.
     <br> For the math to work, you must leave the beef out at room temperature for at least 6 hours.</p>

     <h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>

    <li>1 (4 pound) bone-in prime rib roast (room temperature)</li>
    <li>Â¼ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon herbes de Provence</li>
    <li>kosher salt to taste</li>

</ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients. Place prime rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, 
        2 to 4 hours. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>

    <li>Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well blended.
         Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season roast generously with kosher salt.</li>

    <li>Roast the 4-pound roast in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. 
        (If your roast is larger or smaller than 4 pounds, multiply the exact weight times 5 minutes.)</li>

    <li>Turn the oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, 
        let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours.</li>

    <li>Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve.</li>
</ol>
